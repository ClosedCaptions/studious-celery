# Crushed Can Experiment

## What is it
After a soda can is heated, it is placed into cold water, causing the can to collapse.

## Purpose
Demonstrates atmospheric pressure and pressure imbalance.

## How it works
When the can is heated, the water inside boils. When the can is inverted and placed into cold water, the steam turns into liquid water, leaving a vacuum inside the can. Due to the pressure imbalance of internal vacuum and normal external pressure, the external pressure attempts to balance the pressure difference, thus the can collapses inward.
