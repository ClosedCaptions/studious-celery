# Crushed Can Experiment

## What is it
After a soda can is heated, it is placed into cold water, causing the can to collapse.

## Purpose
Demonstrates atmospheric pressure and pressure imbalance.

## How it works
First of all, open the can. When the can is heated, the temperature of the water will increase. When the can is inverted and placed into cold water quickly, the temperature drops, leaving a relative lower pressure inside the can than air pressure. Due to the pressure imbalance of internal vacuum and normal external pressure, the external pressure attempts to balance the pressure difference, thus the can collapses inward.
