# Magdebourg Hemispheres

## What is it
An experiment with two hollow copper hemispheres sealed together, making a hollow sphere. The air inside the hollow sphere is pumped out, so the inside of the sphere is a vacuum.

## Purpose
Demonstrates how strong atmospheric pressure is. 8 horses on each side of the hemispheres could not pull apart the suction between the two hemispheres.

## How it works
Two copper hemispheres are bolted together into a hollow sphere, and the air inside is pumped out. Internally, the vacuum creates a pulling force towards the centre of the hollow sphere, but it does not collapse internally due to the strength and force of the copper material.
